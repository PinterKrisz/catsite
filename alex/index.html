            <p class="introduction-parag">Here in this site i want to introduce some of the most
                beautiful cat breeds, especially my personal favorite,
                the Russian Blue breed.

                    <h3>Russian Blue</h3>
                    <div class="russianblue-img"></div>
                    <p>Gentle and family friendly type with a huge<br>
                        need of attention when his/her owner is around <br>
                        but he wont destroy your house if you're not home. <br>
                        Her/his coat is very soft, so generally this type <br>
                        is a lovely furball. If you got kids, there's no <br>
                        better choiche than this breed in my opinion.

                    <h3>Bengal</h3>
                    <div class="bengal-img"></div>
                    <p>Bengal cats have a feral and exotic look <br>
                        but make ideal feline pets. This breed is noted <br> 
                        for its spotted coat and muscular build. <br> 
                        Because of its feral origins, the Persian cat is <br> 
                        much larger in size compared to your average pet cat. <br>
                        Personality-wise, Bengals are affectionate, <br>
                        child- and dog-friendly, and very social. In addition, <br>
                        they are energetic and extremely playful.

                    <h3>Ashera</h3>
                    <div class="ashera-img"></div>
                    <p>This exotic breed is a hybrid of <br>
                        the Asian leopard cat, a domestic housecat,<br> 
                        and the African serval. Personality-wise, it is loyal, <br>
                        affectionate, and very intelligent. <br>
                         Despite the controversy about its genetics, <br> 
                         the Ashera is the most prized pet cat in the world <br>
                          and you can take one home if you can cough up <br> 
                          the astronomical price.

                    <div class="savannah-img"></div>
                    <p>A hybrid of the wild African serval cat <br> 
                        and a domestic Persian cat. <br>
                        Like dogs, Savannah cats are extremely loyal. <br> 
                        They are open to socializing with other pets and strangers <br> 
                        if trained at an early age. In addition, they are <br> 
                        smart, curious, playful, and active, and need plenty of exercise.

                    <div class="sphynx-img"></div>
                    <p>The Sphynx is known for its hairless look caused by a <br>
                        natural genetic mutation, which created a healthy <br>
                        and strong breed. Sphynx cats love socializing and are <br> 
                        friendly with strangers. However, they need to be <br> 
                        bathed often as they pile up body oils on their skin. <br> 
                        In addition, they are not comfortable outdoors.

                    <div class="persian-img"></div>
                    <p>The Persian cat is widely recognized by its mushy face <br>
                        and fluffy hair. It enjoys showing affection and cuddling, <br> 
                        but is not very vocal. Their furry coat needs daily grooming <br> 
                        and brushing. This breed comes in multiple variations and colors.
